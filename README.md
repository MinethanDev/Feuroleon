## Details

Feuroléon is a Discord bot created in 2022 from a joke. Feuroléon's original function is to reply "Feur" to anyone ending their message with "Quoi". Since then, Feuroléon has expanded to include different types of French jokes and other features.

Feuroléon has just received its V2 update. This update adds nothing new, apart from the /orthographe command. The main purpose of this update is to optimize the bot, which until now had not been optimized at all.

List of features :
-  "UwU" : Sends Hannah Owo saying UwU
-  "Quoicoubeh" : Sends a cringe gif
-  "/mariage" : Sends a positive or negative response to the user's marriage request
-  "/question" : Sends an answer to a closed question
